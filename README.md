# 💧 AquaNeuraX — AI Guardian of Industrial Flow  

### 🧠 Powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate | Agentic AI for Sustainable Water Infrastructure  

---

## 🌍 Overview  
**AquaNeuraX** is an **AI-driven orchestration system** that brings neural intelligence to **industrial water management**.  
It monitors pump data — such as vibration, motor current, and temperature — to predict failures, prevent water waste, and ensure sustainable industrial performance.  

The system uses **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** to automate data analysis, reporting, and maintenance recommendations through **agentic AI workflows**.  
Each agent acts autonomously but collaborates intelligently — turning reactive maintenance into **proactive sustainability**.

## 🧠 Agent Architecture  

1. **Data Analyzer Agent**  
   - Processes CSV or real-time IoT data.  
   - Applies rules/ML to classify pump status.  

2. **Predictive Maintenance Agent**  
   - Detects early warnings and recommends preventive actions.  

3. **Report Agent**  
   - Generates formatted daily summaries in PDF.  

4. **Advisory Agent**  
   - Interacts with users conversationally via watsonx Orchestrate.

## 🔗 Workflow with IBM watsonx Orchestrate  

1️⃣ Upload pump dataset (CSV or IoT feed).  
2️⃣ Orchestrate triggers **Data Analyzer Agent**.  
3️⃣ Analyzer outputs JSON results → sent to **Maintenance Agent**.  
4️⃣ **Report Agent** compiles insights into a PDF summary.  
5️⃣ **Advisory Agent** communicates results & recommendations to the user.

## 🚀 How to Run (Hackathon Demo Steps)  

1️⃣ Open **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** dashboard.  
2️⃣ Import the AquaNeuraX agent configuration.  
3️⃣ Upload your sample dataset (`water_pump_health_data.csv`).  
4️⃣ Trigger workflow: `Run Daily Pump Analysis`.  
5️⃣ View generated report → check email or COS bucket for output.  
6️⃣ Ask the agent questions like:  
   - “Analyze today’s pump performance.”  
   - “Show pumps at risk of failure.”  
   - “Summarize energy efficiency trends.”

## 🧩 Example Query & Response  

**Query:**  
> “AquaNeuraX, can you check the latest vibration trend for Pump ID P-301?”

**Response:**  
> ✅ Pump P-301 shows an upward vibration trend (3.1 → 5.4 mm/s).  
> ⚠️ Early imbalance detected — schedule lubrication within 48 hours.  
> 📊 Classification: *WARNING*
